# libdesktop

OS and desktop integration made easy.

A cross-platform library for miscellaneous OS functions and conveniences.
Things, quirks and workarounds I've figured out, so you don't have to.

*NOTE:* This library is not related *in any way* to `libdesktop-agnostic`.

# Usage

Install:

```bash
$ pip3 install libdesktop
```

You may need to use `sudo -H` with this.

Windows and macOS users: replace `pip3` with `pip` or whatever the Python 3 `pip` is.

Simply:

```python
import libdesktop
```
and call functions. See [documentation](#documentation)
